# BrownDwarf-SpectralIndices
Method to determine if ONE brown dwarf is a candidate to be a photometric variable or non-variable, by means of the study of spectral indices.

This first version works in Python and the only modifications to be made at the beginning of the code are:
  - Path and name of the file containing the brown dwarf spectrum.
  - Define whether it is an L-type or T-type brown dwarf.
  - Whether or not to save a .pdf file with the index-index plot

Outputs:
- In how many graphs this object appears in the variable area
- whether it is a variable or non-variable candidate
- (optional) The index-index chart of the object

Future versions:
Decide to use the method for a single object or a list of objects.
